Thanking the Maintainers
------------------------

Maintaining PicklePipe is done entirely through volunteer time by people who
have full-time jobs in addition to their Open Source work. Like most Open Source work,
this is almost always thankless, but that does not stop us from wanting to create
professional-grade software and build the Python Open Source community.

If you've used PicklePipe and found it useful feel free to leave a quick thank you
message to the maintainers of this project. It will really make our day! ❤️
