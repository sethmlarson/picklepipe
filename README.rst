Python pickling protocol over any network interface. Also provides a basic interface to implement your own serializing pipes.

This project was started and released in under 24 hours while I was on holiday break.

Getting Started with PicklePipe
-------------------------------

PicklePipe is available on PyPI can be installed with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_.::

    $ python -m pip install picklepipe

To install the latest development version from `Github <https://github.com/SethMichaelLarson/picklepipe>`_::

    $ python -m pip install git+git://github.com/SethMichaelLarson/picklepipe.git


If your current Python installation doesn't have pip available, try `get-pip.py <bootstrap.pypa.io>`_

After installing PicklePipe you can use it like any other Python module.
Here's a very simple demonstration of scheduling a single job on a farm.

.. code-block:: python

    import picklepipe

    # Create a pair of connected pipes.
    pipe1, pipe2 = picklepipe.make_pipe_pair(picklepipe.PicklePipe)

    # Send an object in one end.
    pipe1.send_object('Hello, world!')

    # And retrieve it from the other.
    obj = pipe2.recv_object(timeout=1.0)

    assert obj == 'Hello, world!'

    # Also can be used to send objects to remote locations!
    import socket
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.connect(('host', 12345))
    pipe = picklepipe.PicklePipe(sock)
    pipe.send_object('Hello, world!')
    pipe.close()
